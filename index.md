### Description: 

The first part of the lesson on Thursday, the first half of the lesson is about the human brain and eyes. During class, Mr. Jonathan had students participate in an activity to demonstrate that humans have short memories, the task is to look at a random number, memorize it and then read aloud a difficult-to-pronunce paragrahp, then Then teacher Jonathan asks the students to indicate the random number at the beginning. Only some students can remember it, the rest can't remember it correctly. When we come to the lesson about the human eye, there are many interesting activities. First is watching the video, the point of watching this video is spotting a gorilla that some people don't recognize. Next is to see some confusing 3D artwork even though the human eye can still be fooled by the psychedelic art after explaining. The last activity is to see a very difficult picture and spot a dog. The Korean girl in my class soon found out about the dog even she saw a crocodile while bending over, some of the other students needed a lot of times to see the dog in that picture. The second half of the lesson is about air crash investigation, mostly to watch a video and answer some questions from Mr.Jonathan.

### Feeling: 

During class, I was really confused by those psychedelic images. When it comes to the picture of looking for a dog, my friends and I are very positive because we are competing. The class was really relaxing and unpredictable, I really hope in the future I can have classes like this. Regarding the lesson, in the first half is more likely to be studying medicine because students have to go through short memory, long memory, eye structure. Season two is about air accident investigations, which I really love because I often watch some of the Boeing crash investigations on Netflix and Discovery. One of the goals that I achieved while watching the Mr.Jonathan video was that I could watch and understand the content without any subtitles.

### Action plan:

After that lesson, I had a chat with Mr.Jonathan about air crash investingations that I watched on Netflix and I found that my English speaking skill is still not perfect, I usually get stumbled while speaking English. In the future I will need to practice more by seeking oppertunities to have a chat with foreigners.
